<h3><a class="button-redbg" href="https://www.safestbettingsites.com/visit/betnow-ncaabblogs/" data-action="ncaa 2020-21 preview">Bet On The NCAA Championship Winner At BetNow</a></h3>
</div>



<h2 class="heading icon icon-basketball" id="location">NCAA Basketball Tournament In One Location</h2>



<p>The first major change to the 2020-21 season won&#8217;t be felt until the month of March, but it is a major change. </p>



<p>The entire 2021 NCAA Tournament is set to be held in one location, and <strong>Indianapolis will likely be chosen as the host</strong>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It&#8217;s unclear how much of an effect the tournament change will have, but it is something to keep in mind when making NCAA championship bets. </p>



<p>Teams could also be dealing with COVID-19 at that time, and it could knock out some of the favorites.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="heading icon icon-calendarclock" id="schedule">Schedule Changes Will Be Frequent</h2>



<p>Another thing that will be common throughout the college basketball season is that games will be forced to be canceled or postponed each week. </p>



<p>This same thing has happened to the 2020 college football season, and there is simply no way around it.</p>



<p>These schedule changes could certainly affect some conference races as the season plays out, but each league is hopeful that it is able to play an entire season. </p>



<p>If you are planning on making some conference outright bets, then it might be wise to <strong>wait until a little closer to conference action</strong>.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="heading icon icon-fivestars" id="favorites">NCAA Season&#8217;s Favorites</h2>



<p>Winning the NCAA Championship is never an easy task, and technically all of the teams listed above could be considered the favorite. </p>



<p>There are some other teams that stand out more than the rest, and <strong>these three teams will be tough to beat this season</strong>.</p>



<h3 class="heading skyblue">Baylor +800</h3>



<p><a href="https://www.safestbettingsites.com/ncaa-basketball-betting/teams/baylor-bears"><strong>Baylor</strong></a> spent a majority of last season ranked No. 1 in the country, and the Bears should be loaded again this season. </p>



<p>The Bears have a very experienced team, and this team knows how to defend.</p>



<p>The Big 12 Conference should be tough again this season, and that will have Baylor ready to make a deep run in the NCAA Tournament.</p>



<h3 class="heading skyblue">Gonzaga +500</h3>



<p>The <a href="https://www.safestbettingsites.com/ncaa-basketball-betting/teams/gonzaga-bulldogs"><strong>Gonzaga Bulldogs</strong></a> are now a perennial Final Four contender, and they always put up huge numbers in the regular season. </p>



<p>Head coach Mark Few has accomplished a ton during his career, but a national title is still missing from his resume.</p>



<p>This could be the year that Gonzaga finishes the season on top and cuts down the nets.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="heading skyblue">Iowa +750</h3>



<p>Iowa center Luka Garza is coming back to school, and he is the best player in the country. </p>



<p><strong>The Hawkeyes</strong> will have one of the deepest teams in the country this season, and they can really score the basketball.&nbsp;</p>



<div class="highlight-box success" style="text-align: center;">
<h3><a class="button-redbg" href="https://www.safestbettingsites.com/visit/betnow-ncaabblogs/" data-action="ncaa 2020-21 preview">Bet On This Season&#8217;s Favorites At BetNow</a></h3>
</div>



<h2 class="heading icon icon-launch" id="underdogs">NCAA Season&#8217;s Underdogs</h2>



<p>Even though these three teams below are listed among the top 16 teams above, <strong>each of them enters the 2020-21 season with something to prove</strong>. </p>



<p>Don&#8217;t be surprised to see one of these underdogs win the title this season.</p>



<h3 class="heading skyblue">Illinois +1200</h3>



<p>The<strong> Illinois Fighting Illini</strong> are led by Ayo Dosunmu and Kofi Cockburn, and both players will likely be lottery picks in the NBA Draft at the end of this season. </p>



<p>Illinois was one of the hottest teams in the country at the end of the 2019-20 campaign, and that momentum should carry over into this season.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="heading skyblue">Michigan State +1650</h3>



<p>The <strong>Michigan State Spartans</strong> have just one national championship under head coach Tom Izzo, but this team is a perennial Final Four contender. </p>



<p>In a year that will have a lot of uncertainty, this could be the time for Izzo and the Spartans to break through and win it all.</p>



<h3 class="heading skyblue">Creighton +2000</h3>



<p>The <strong>Creighton Bluejays</strong> were one of the most underrated teams in the country a season ago, but they were a team that had a chance to win it all. </p>



<p>Creighton can score points in a hurry, and this team will have plenty of experience.&nbsp;</p>



<div class="highlight-box success" style="text-align: center;">
<h3><a class="button-redbg" href="https://www.safestbettingsites.com/visit/betnow-ncaabblogs/" data-action="ncaa 2020-21 preview">Bet On This Season&#8217;s Underdogs At BetNow</a></h3>
</div>



<h2 class="heading icon icon-highlights" id="conference">Power 5 Conference Previews</h2>



<p>Along with betting on which team will win the 2021 NCAA Championship, conference outright betting is also available. </p>



<p>This is a bet on <strong>which team will win the regular-season title in each conference</strong>.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="heading style2">ACC</h3>



<table class="style2" style="max-width: 400px; margin: 0 auto 10px;">

     </tbody>
</table>
<br>



<p>In the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC), it appears to be a two-team race, though Florida State and North Carolina could also be in the mix. </p>



<p>Virginia is the reigning national champion, and Duke once again had one of the best recruiting classes in the country.</p>



<p><strong>Virginia is the team to beat in the ACC this season, and they are the smart pick here</strong>.&nbsp;</p>

<br>



<p>Kansas was the winner of the Big 12 regular-season title a season ago, and it has absolutely dominated the conference over the past decade. </p>



<p>Even though Baylor is likely the team that will advance the farthest in the NCAA Tournament, <strong>Kansas at <a href="https://www.safestbettingsites.com/visit/betnow-ncaabblogs/">+200</a> is the team to beat</strong> in the Big 12 Conference.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Big Ten Conference will be the best conference in college basketball next season, and there are four teams that have a legitimate shot of winning the regular-season title. </p>



<p>This conference could also produce numerous Final Four contenders as there is a ton of talent in this league.</p>



<p><strong>The best pick to win the Big Ten Conference is Illinois at <a href="https://www.safestbettingsites.com/visit/betnow-ncaabblogs/">+340</a></strong>. The Fighting Illini are led by a pair of potential lottery picks, and this team is loaded with young talent as well.</p>

<p>The SEC will likely be a two-team race next season between Kentucky and Tennessee. There are some other teams that will be in the mix, but the Wildcats and Volunteers are easily the conference&#8217;s two best.</p>



<p>Kentucky is the easy pick, but don&#8217;t be surprised to see Tennessee surprise everyone this season and win the SEC. Take the <strong>Volunteers at <a href="https://www.safestbettingsites.com/visit/betnow-ncaabblogs/">+350</a> to win the SEC in 2020-21</strong>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Oregon is considered a team that could reach the Final Four this season, but it is not even favored to win its own conference. </p>



<p>The Arizona State Sun Devils are the preseason favorites in what should be an exciting race in the Pac-12.</p>



<p>The smart money is still on Oregon as it is simply too talented. <strong>Take the Ducks at <a href="https://www.safestbettingsites.com/visit/betnow-ncaabblogs/">+450</a> to win the Pac-12 this season</strong>.&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>I’m in a bit of a slump right now. Joe is not doing great either, but this dude will celebrate a push like the Philadelphia Eagles will do a tie.</p>



<p>It’s time to bounce back after a couple of rough weeks. A lot of betting lines were off for many days because of QB injuries and COVID-19 cases. </p>



<p>Either way, here are the <strong>best ATS picks for the NFL Week 11</strong>.</p>



<h2 class="heading icon icon-football">Joe’s NFL Week 11 Picks Against The Spread</h2>



<h3 class="heading style2"><strong>Tampa Bay Buccaneers -4 vs. LA Rams</strong></h3>



<p>The Rams had a statement win against Seattle last week as my Seahawks +2 pick went down in flames. To be honest, I didn’t value Seattle’s injury issues nearly enough and undervalued the Rams defense. </p>



<p>Still, I will go back to the well against the 6-3 Rams that are now tied for the top record in the NFC West.</p>



<p>They will face a tough opponent on Monday Night Football, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. The Bucs are coming off a statement win against Carolina where they put up 46 points. They have a 7-3 record now, but still, trail the Saints in the division.</p>



<p>Tampa is firing on all cylinders right now. Their poor performance against the Saints was an aberration, but we still may be getting a discount on them in betting markets because of it. The reality is that teams play badly some weeks, for whatever reason.</p>



<p>I love this matchup for Tampa and I think this number should be closer to -6. The Buccaneers defense will be able to pressure Goff, something that Seattle was not able to do last week. <strong>Lay the points with the home team.</strong></p>



<div class="highlight-box success" style="text-align: center;">
<h3><a class="button-redbg" href="https://www.safestbettingsites.com/visit/betnow-nflpicks/" data-action="nfl wk 11 ats">Bet Buccaneers -4 At BetNow</a></h3>
</div>



<h3 class="heading style2"><strong>Green Bay Packers +1.5 at Indianapolis</strong> Colts</h3>



<p>The Packers probably scared a lot of survivor league players last week as they narrowly won escaped with a victory against the visiting Jacksonville Jaguars. The win moved them to 7-2, where they have a massive lead in the NFC North.</p>



<p>We last saw the Colts on TNF where they demolished the Titans to match them in record at 6-3 and grab ahold of the AFC South, via tiebreaker. This game was close until the Colts dominated the second half, outsourcing Tennesee 21-0.</p>



<p>We have to give credit to the Jaguars as they did hold down the potent Packers’ offense. However, I think their performance was likely at the bottom range of their outcomes. </p>



<p>The Colts have a much better offense than Jax, but their defense is far from an imposing matchup for Aaron Rodgers and Davante Adams.</p>



<p>If the Packers beat the Jaguars by 20 points, then we may see a far different price here. Perhaps, even Green Bay as a road favorite. The market is a bit too down on them in this spot.</p>



<p>Aaron Rodgers has also been fantastic this season, but especially indoors, where playing conditions are perfect. <strong>Take the road dog on the points or the underdog moneyline.</strong></p>



<div class="highlight-box success" style="text-align: center;">
<h3><a class="button-redbg" href="https://www.safestbettingsites.com/visit/betnow-nflpicks/" data-action="nfl wk 11 ats">Bet Packers +1.5 At BetNow</a></h3>
</div>



<h3 class="heading style2"><strong>Kansas City Chiefs -7 at Las Vegas</strong> Raiders</h3>



<p>These two teams played each other earlier in the season, with the Raiders springing the upset in KC back in Week 7. </p>



<p>They won in Arrowhead by a score of 40-32. KC is coming off a bye last week with their last appearance being against the lowly Jets. A game they easily won to improve their record to 8-1.</p>



<p>Las Vegas moved to 6-3 after taking care of business against the visiting Broncos. The game wasn’t much of a sweat for the Raiders. They destroyed their AFC West rivals by a score of 37-12.</p>



<p>There is some concern with KC having two tackles under COVID protocols, but I still love the <a href="https://www.safestbettingsites.com/nfl-betting/teams/chiefs">Chiefs</a> here. They lost to this team once this season, but that may be a positive as Andy Reid will have one of his best gameplans in place for this matchup.</p>



<p>The market offers us a little value due to the recent run by LV, as well. They’re 3-0 over the past three weeks, but their wins haven’t exactly come against elite teams, in the Browns, Chargers, and Broncos.</p>



<p>This one is off the board at some sportsbooks, but if you look hard enough you will certainly find a KC -7. <strong>Lay the points with the best team in football on the road without hesitation</strong>.</p>

<h2 class="heading icon icon-football">Alonzo’s NFL Week 11 Picks Against The Spread</h2>



<h3 class="heading style2"><strong>Atlanta Falcons +4.5 at New Orleans</strong></h3>



<p>As you know Drew Brees will be out for several weeks with multiple broken ribs. Jameis Winston will be under center to face the <a href="https://www.safestbettingsites.com/nfl-betting/teams/falcons">Falcons</a>. </p>



<p>Beyond making fun of Winston’s 30 interceptions last season, what worries me is that I don’t think he has the grasps of this offense. Winston needs repetitions with the first team, and he hasn’t done that.</p>



<p>Last week against the Niners, he looked overwhelmed and was sacked twice because he held the ball too long. Atlanta also knows him, so this isn’t anything new for the Falcons. It is just the same Winston in a new uniform.</p>



<p>Atlanta has won three of their four games since firing Dan Quinn. It should have been four straight wins if not for Todd Gurley’s last-second TD three weeks ago. </p>



<p>The Falcons are coming off a bye week. They are playing better lately and have a favorable matchup.</p>



<p>When the now HC Raheem Morris took over as defensive coordinator last season, they destroyed the Saints 26-9 even though New Orleans was a huge favorite. <strong>Take the points.</strong></p>



<div class="highlight-box success" style="text-align: center;">
<h3><a class="button-redbg" href="https://www.safestbettingsites.com/visit/betnow-nflpicks/" data-action="nfl wk 11 ats">Bet Falcons +4.5 At BetNow</a></h3>
</div>



<h3 class="heading style2"><strong>Jacksonville Jaguars +10 vs. Steelers</strong></h3>



<p>I know it’s hard to lay down points on a team with eight straight losses but hear me out. Despite losing all the time, the Jags are a competitive team who stays within range to cover games.</p>



<p>In the last three outings, they have covered the spread. They lost by ten against the Chargers in a game they were leading most of the time. Then they lost against the Texans by two points and against the Packers by four.</p>



<p>Jacksonville will be at home, and the heat and humidity will play in their favor. Pittsburgh is a better team, don’t get wrong, but the Steelers sometimes have these games where they don’t give it all.</p>



<p><strong>Pittsburgh will take the win, but Jacksonville will come back late to cover and give us the win.</strong></p>



<div class="highlight-box success" style="text-align: center;">
<h3><a class="button-redbg" href="https://www.safestbettingsites.com/visit/betnow-nflpicks/" data-action="nfl wk 11 ats">Bet Jaguars +10 At BetNow</a></h3>
</div>



<h3 class="heading style2"><strong>New England Patriots -1.5 at Houston</strong></h3>



<p>The <a href="https://www.safestbettingsites.com/nfl-betting/teams/patriots">Patriots</a> have won two games in a row and are learning to win with the little talent they have on both sides of the ball. The win against Baltimore last week was impressive.</p>



<p>The spread of this game is too small not to take advantage of it. New England actually believes they are a good team, and while I’m not sure about that, they are better than Houston. </p>



<p>The Texans have only beaten Jaguars this season. They are coming off a weak offensive performance against the Browns where they only scored one touchdown.</p>



<p>Bill Belichick should outclass Romeo Crennel and take a third straight win to put his team at .500. <strong>Bet the Patriots.</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Half a million dollars are on the line in one of the biggest Dota events left on the calendar in 2020</strong>. With Team Secret looking to bounce back to their winning ways after a fourth-place finish at ESL One Germany 2020.</p>



<p>Even without The International, Dota competitions continue around the world in regional fashion to tide us over until Valve’s new league system kicks in.</p>



<p>That being said, the first season of EPIC League is no placeholder event, featuring some of the biggest European and CIS players, including Alexey “Solo” Berezin’s newly formed superteam.</p>



<h2 class="heading icon icon-searchme">Team Secret Dominates But Falters Late</h2>



<p>Team Secret have dominated the online era of Dota 2 with Puppey’s men winning seven consecutive grand finals with a 3-0 scoreline.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, they couldn’t keep up their blistering form after a return from their short break, losing to Team Liquid and mudgolems in shock fashion, with the former winning the entire event.</p>



<p>Both teams are also present in EPIC League’s top division, promising a swathe of exciting rematches.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unlike Secret or Liquid, mudgolems made it through the closed qualifiers alongside Just Error (also known as 404), Solo’s new project built on the remnants of the past great Virtus.pro sides, augmented by TI5 winner SumaiL.</p>



<p><strong>Secret still remains the team to beat</strong> but it is now an actual possibility rather than a mere mirage.</p>



<h3 class="heading style2">Other Teams&#8217; Situations</h3>



<p>Meanwhile, VP opted to promote their academy roster to the main org off the back of some promising performances, but it remains to be seen whether they can go up against the top dogs in a raucous round robin format.</p>



<p>Two of the other big-name invitees are still lacking their full roster.</p>



<p>Team Nigma has to keep going without talismanic captain KuroKy, who’s still out after his surgery (replaced by their coach).</p>



<p>OG’s ana took yet another customary break for the non-TI portion of the circuit, making them somewhat less effective than they would be at full strength.</p>



<div class="highlight-box success" style="text-align: center;">
<h3><a class="button-redbg" href="https://www.safestbettingsites.com/visit/betnow/" data-action="dota epic league div 1 cta">Start Betting On Dota 2 EPIC League At BetNow</a></h3>
</div>



<h2 class="heading icon icon-highlights">Dota 2 EPIC League&#8217;s Group Stage</h2>



<p>The group stage matches begin on November 12 and last until December 5. The playoffs follow after a three-day break, beginning on December 8 with the grand finals taking place on December 13.</p>



<p>Every match is a best-of-three affair, as is customary in top tier Dota.</p>



<h3 class="heading style2">EPIC League Dota Day One Matchups</h3>



<p>The day one matchups pit VP and OG against each other first, followed by a match between Liquid and Natus Vincere.</p>



<h4 class="heading-slashbg-container">VP Vs. OG Matchup</h4>



<p>This one is considered to be a close affair by the bookies, with <strong>OG the slight favorite at -129</strong>, which seems good value for money if only because of any upheaval that may stem from VP’s new roster still settling in.</p>



<h4 class="heading-slashbg-container">Liquid Vs. Natus Vincere Matchup</h4>



<p><strong>Liquid’s</strong> a bigger favorite here than the back-to-back TI winners <strong>in their own matchup at -156,</strong> which seems a good shout considering their recent uptick in form which led to their title-winning run in “Germany” (you know, online).</p>



<h3 class="heading style2">EPIC League Dota Day Two Matchups</h3>



<p>Day two sees Liquid and OG return to the arena, against Vikin.gg and Alliance respectively.</p>



<p>Seeing how they need to play on back-to-back days while their opponents don’t, <strong>we suggest betting against them for these matchups</strong>.</p>



<p>Team Vikin.gg is offered at +126 and Team Alliance is actually considered the favorite by the bookies at -134.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Joe took the first-place last week after I stumbled on a few NFL picks. No excuse from my side.</p>



<p>The good thing is I’ve bounced back every week, and that’s precisely what I intend to do in the NFL Week 10.</p>



<p>If you missed our NFL Week 10 preview, give it a look to see the line movements and recent injuries.</p>



<p>Now, let’s get some winners.</p>



<h2 class="heading icon icon-football">Joe’s NFL Week 10 Picks Against The Spread</h2>



<h3 class="heading style2">Seattle Seahawks +2 at Los Angeles Rams</h3>



<p>I went with Seattle last week against Buffalo, but the Seahawks defense crumbled under the offensive pressure on the Bills.</p>



<p>This NFC West matchup sees the Rams come off a bye in Week 9. The last time we saw them, they lost on the road to Miami Dolphins.</p>



<p>I like this as a bounce-back spot for an excellent Seattle team. There’s no denying their defense is awful, but I still feel like if we look at Goff vs. Wilson &#8211; the Seahawks have an edge here.</p>



<p>It’s not as simple as that, but we’re still getting the best team in the division as a dog. I don’t need more than that to place a wager on Seattle.</p>



<p><strong>I think the +2 is fine but you could also go with the +108 moneyline on the Seahawks</strong>.</p>



<div class="highlight-box success" style="text-align: center;">
<h3><a class="button-redbg" href="https://www.safestbettingsites.com/visit/betnow/" data-action="nfl wk 10 ats">Bet Seahawks +2 At BetNow</a></h3>
</div>



<h3 class="heading style2">Houston Texans +3 at Cleveland Browns</h3>



<p>This one isn’t the most attractive game on the board, but I think there is some betting value to be had here.</p>



<p>Houston visits Cleveland after coming off a 27-25 win last week. Cleveland is coming off a bye in Week 9. Their last game was an awful 16-6 loss in Week 8 against the visiting Raiders.</p>



<p>Houston is not a good football team but they have been much more competitive since they fired Bill O’Brien.</p>



<p>Cleveland’s performance two weeks ago was awful. The weather played a part, but I think this offense may have a much harder time scoring without Odell Beckham.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>I like the Texans getting a field goal here on the road.</strong></p>



<div class="highlight-box success" style="text-align: center;">
<h3><a class="button-redbg" href="https://www.safestbettingsites.com/visit/betnow/" data-action="nfl wk 10 ats">Bet Texans +3 At BetNow</a></h3>
</div>



<h3 class="heading style2">Tampa Bay Buccaneers -5 at Carolina Panthers</h3>



<p>These two NFC South foes faced off in Tampa in Week 2, a game that was easily won by the Bucs by a score of 31-17.</p>



<p>Tampa is coming off an awful Monday Night loss against the Saints while Carolina was defeated in a high scoring game in Kansas City in Week 9.</p>



<p>I love this spot for Tampa Bay. They already beat Carolina earlier this year and they’re in a prime bounce-back spot.</p>



<p>New Orleans was able to pressure Brady up the middle and disrupt Tampa’s offense, but I don’t expect the same from the Panthers.</p>



<p>Their defense is awful. Sure, their offense will put up some points but Tampa’s defense is still a strong unit despite what we saw last week against New Orleans.</p>



<p><strong>Lay the points with the road favorite in this one.</strong></p>



<div class="highlight-box success" style="text-align: center;">
<h3><a class="button-redbg" href="https://www.safestbettingsites.com/visit/betnow/" data-action="nfl wk 10 ats">Bet Buccaneers -5 At BetNow</a></h3>
</div>



<h2 class="heading icon icon-football">Alonzo’s NFL Week 10 Picks Against The Spread</h2>



<h3 class="heading style2">Carolina Panthers +5.5 vs. Buccaneers</h3>



<p>I expect the Buccaneers to bounce back from an awful display on Sunday night and beat the Panthers. But laying down 5.5 for a team trying to find their identity is just too much.</p>



<p>Tampa Bay is struggling to protect Tom Brady, and they are not a balanced team either. They have problems establishing the run, especially when things are not going their way. Last week they had only five rushing attempts against the Saints.</p>



<p>Carolina also gave Kansas City a run for their money. They were outmuscled in the end because the <a href="https://www.safestbettingsites.com/nfl-betting/teams/chiefs" data-type="page" data-id="22855">Chiefs</a> have way too much talent, but the Panthers were in the game all afternoon.</p>



<p>This is a divisional matchup between two teams that can keep the pace of the other. <strong>You are better off taking the points</strong>.</p>



<div class="highlight-box success" style="text-align: center;">
<h3><a class="button-redbg" href="https://www.safestbettingsites.com/visit/betnow/" data-action="nfl wk 10 ats">Bet Panthers +5.5 At BetNow</a></h3>
</div>



<h3 class="heading style2">Arizona Cardinals -2.5 vs. Bills</h3>



<p>I know many people are jumping back on the Bills bandwagon, but don’t save a seat for me. Whatever the Bills showed last week against the Seahawks is not their reality, but Seattle’s reality of a lousy defense.</p>



<p>QB Josh Allen completed only 11 passes and threw one interception without touchdowns against the Patriots two weeks ago. Then he completed 81% of his passes against Seattle, with three touchdowns scores.</p>



<p>Arizona’s’ defense is way better than Seattle’s. The Seahawks total defense is the worst in the NFL since 1978. So, they are not a measuring stick.</p>



<p>Also, Kyler Murray is balling. He had four touchdowns last week against Miami. The Dolphins have a better defense than Buffalo. <strong>Swallow the points</strong>.</p>



<div class="highlight-box success" style="text-align: center;">
<h3><a class="button-redbg" href="https://www.safestbettingsites.com/visit/betnow/" data-action="nfl wk 10 ats">Bet Cardinals -2.5 At BetNow</a></h3>
</div>



<h3 class="heading style2">Baltimore Ravens -7 at New England</h3>



<p>This has to be the first time in the John Harbaugh era that his Ravens are favorites visiting New England.</p>



<p>Both Ravens’ losses this season have been against contenders in the AFC. With a lack of talent on every line, teams like the Patriots are not a problem for them.</p>



<p>Even if New England has a good game plan, they don’t have the players to compete sixty minutes against Baltimore. They are also coming off a short week after struggling to beat the NY Jets.</p>



<p>I’m sure John Harbaugh will want to beat the Patriots by a thousand points if he can. So, don’t expect the <a href="https://www.safestbettingsites.com/nfl-betting/teams/ravens" data-type="page" data-id="20543">Baltimore Ravens</a> to take the foot off the gas at any point in the game.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The 2020 Masters Tournament was <strong>postponed from its traditional and originally scheduled April date to November</strong> because of COVID-19 concerns. </p>



<p>The field remains the same as if the tournament had been held in the spring, except for some withdrawals due to the virus, most notably 2017 champion Sergio Garcia.</p>



<p>Although the Masters will <strong>still be played at the Augusta National Golf Club</strong>, the course is likely to look different than it usually does in April. First, the <strong>grass will be at a higher length</strong> than the players ordinarily see. </p>



<p>That factor could help mitigate the advantage that experience generally affords players with multiple Masters appearances.</p>



<h3 class="heading-slashbg-container">Players Winning The Tournament</h3>



<p>Only one player since 1935 has won the tournament in their initial visit to Augusta National. Fuzzy Zoeller won the 1979 Masters in a playoff in his debut at the storied venue.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a way, although the course is the same, <strong>all players will be rookies</strong> because of the change in the time of year.</p>



<p>Secondly, there will be a very limited number of patrons on-site, and the venue will lack ropes, bleachers, and the famous Sunday afternoon cheers.</p>



<h2 class="heading icon icon-payme">Betting on the Masters</h2>



<p>Virtually all online sportsbooks offer wagers on the <a href="https://www.safestbettingsites.com/golf-betting/masters">Masters</a>. The most common are futures bets where the wager is on who will win the tournament. </p>



<p>Another popular option is a matchup bet, where players are paired together, and odds are established on which of the two will perform better.</p>



<p>The <strong>matchup bets are available for the entire tournament</strong> and also for the next round. Because the pairings have nothing to do with how the players are grouped on the golf course, virtually any combination is possible.</p>



<p>I used <a href="http://safestbettingsites.com/visit/betnow/">www.betnow.eu</a> for the odds used in this piece. <strong>The site is easy to navigate</strong> and offers a nice number of wagering options. </p>



<p>For the futures betting, BetNow has odds on 27 players but also has a bet available on anyone not included in that group winning the tournament.</p>



<div class="highlight-box success" style="text-align: center;">
<h3><a class="button-redbg" href="https://www.safestbettingsites.com/visit/betnow/" data-action="betting on 2020 masters">Bet On The Masters At BetNow.eu</a></h3>
</div>



<h2 class="heading icon icon-moneystack">Betting Odds for Futures Wagers</h2>



<p>The favorite for the Masters is U.S. Open champion Bryson DeChambeau with odds of <a href="http://safestbettingsites.com/visit/betnow/">+850</a>. That means <strong>a $100 wager on DeChambeau will pay out $950</strong> ($850 winnings plus the original $100 bet). </p>



<p>DeChambeau has been creating a lot of buzz as he works on maximizing his length off the tee.</p>



<p><strong>The favorite&#8217;s best finish at Augusta is a tie for 21st</strong>. Despite his win in the U.S. Open at Winged Foot, I just don&#8217;t see DeChambeau donning the green jacket, which goes to the winner, on Sunday afternoon.</p>



<h3 class="heading-slashbg-container">The #1 Player In The World</h3>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img src="https://www.safestbettingsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Webp.net-resizeimage.jpg" alt="Dustin Johnson World Champion" class="wp-image-48105" width="239" height="200" srcset="https://www.safestbettingsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Webp.net-resizeimage.jpg 641w, https://www.safestbettingsites.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Webp.net-resizeimage-300x252.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 239px) 100vw, 239px" /></figure></div>



<p>Just behind DeChambeau in the odds is the current FedEx Cup champion and former U.S. Open winner Dustin Johnson. <strong>The No. 1 player in the world is at</strong> <a href="http://safestbettingsites.com/visit/betnow/">+900</a>, and no one has been hotter than Johnson since early August. </p>



<p>He&#8217;s notched two wins, three second-place finishes, and a tie for sixth to his credit.</p>



<p>He&#8217;s finished in the top 10 in the last four Masters, including a tie for second behind Tiger Woods in 2019. At the odds being offered, there&#8217;s no doubt that <strong>Johnson needs to be on every bettor&#8217;s wager list</strong>.</p>



<p>Brooks Koepka appears to have recovered from a left knee problem and shot a pair of 65s last week in Houston.</p>



<p>His four titles and consistent performance in the majors since 2017 make a healthy Koepka a real threat. He was one of the players tied with Johnson for second in 2019.</p>



<p>Since winning the 2017 PGA Championship, <strong>Justin Thomas has been looking for a second major title</strong>. Thomas&#8217; best finish at Augusta is a tie for 12th in 2019, but he&#8217;s improved his standing every year. </p>



<p>Since the restart in June, he has a win and three second-place finishes, including in his last start at the Zozo Championship.</p>

<h2 class="heading icon icon-moneystack">Matchup Bets</h2>



<p>In the head-to-head matchup on BetNow, <strong>Dustin Johnson is a 1.5-stroke favorite over Bryson DeChambeau</strong>. In the spread bet, DeChambeau pays <a href="http://safestbettingsites.com/visit/betnow/">-130</a>, while Johnson pays even money. In the moneyline, Johnson is favored at <a href="http://safestbettingsites.com/visit/betnow/">-135</a>, with DeChambeau paying <a href="http://safestbettingsites.com/visit/betnow/">+115</a>.</p>



<p>Another compelling matchup is between Jon Rahm and Xander Schauffele, two players expected to be in the hunt on Sunday. <strong>Rahm is a 1.5-stroke favorite</strong>, with both players paying out at <a href="http://safestbettingsites.com/visit/betnow/">-115</a> on the spread bet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the moneyline bet, Rahm is at <a href="http://safestbettingsites.com/visit/betnow/">-150</a>, while Schauffele is at <a href="http://safestbettingsites.com/visit/betnow/">+130</a>. Schauffele was the third player tied for second in 2019 and has a real chance this week.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In less than one week, President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden will finally face each other on Election Day.</p>



<p><strong>Biden has been leading</strong> with a vanilla ice cream approach to his campaign since the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Although Trump has been getting a little closer in certain battleground states that could determine the election for either candidate.</p>



<p>Most pundits will tell you that <em>their </em>candidate is going to win the election, based on their own bias. </p>



<p>If you can find a middle-ground, Biden is certainly leading and it looks like he’s going to win this thing. But only because Trump is such a gargoyle who is barely capable of normal human functioning.</p>



<p>So, it’s no surprise that the milquetoast Democrats would run somebody like Biden. Everybody’s calling this <strong>the most important election of their lifetimes</strong>. But as usual, both of these candidates suck.</p>



<p>People are tired of staying inside, without any work. Kids can’t go to school full-time.</p>



<p>The world is looking to America next week. Will be.</p>



<p>Screw it.</p>



<h2 class="heading icon icon-usflag">Odds to Win the US Presidential Election</h2>



<table class="style2" style="max-width: 500px; margin: 0 auto 20px;">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Candidate</th>
      <th>Odds</th>

    </tr>
  </tbody>

<h2 class="heading icon icon-questionmark">Who’s Favored to Win the Election?</h2>



<p>Obviously, <strong>Biden’s favored to win the election</strong> next week. Trump has been woefully abysmal this entire year when America has needed a leader the most.</p>



<p>It was clear that his reign as Commander in Chief would be spent steamrolling the Democrats until a natural disaster struck down his narcissism and delusions.</p>



<p>But even after 200,000 COVID-19 deaths, the Democrats don’t mind losing the election, really. </p>



<p>They’ve failed just as much with their lack of backbone against Trump’s record-setting third Supreme Court justice in one term and there’s still no stimulus for Americans during a long withstanding depression/pandemic.</p>



<p>Both political parties in America are wholly corrupt. The duopoly swings back and forth. Like a money-grubbing pendulum hanging above the heads of the American populace.</p>



<p>That’s why the opposition is leading with just a week before Election Day. So it remains to be seen who else can !@#$ this $#! up.</p>



<h3 class="heading-slashbg-container">Odds Breakdown for the General Election</h3>



<table class="style2" style="max-width: 500px; margin: 0 auto 20px;">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Candidate</th>
      <th>Odds</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td> Biden </td>
      <td><a href="https://www.safestbettingsites.com/visit/mybookie-politicsblogs/" data-action="presidential debete 2 odds table">-170</a></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td> Trump </td>
      <td><a href="https://www.safestbettingsites.com/visit/mybookie-politicsblogs/" data-action="presidential debete 2 odds table">+130</a></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>



<p><strong>Biden is favored (-170) to beat Trump (+130)</strong> for the general election. (These odds increased in Biden’s favor by about one percent just in the last hour or so.) This is a heavy lead with gambling odds when there’s only six days before Election Day.</p>



<p>I couldn’t have imagined this would be the outcome, months ago. But then, it would’ve been hard to guess that Trump and the Republican leadership could be so out-of-touch when it came to running the country for the electorate.</p>



<p>Instead, <strong>Trump and his administration have bailed out Wall Street</strong>. And themselves. While the country burns.</p>



<p>Just like the Obama administration helped Wall Street to loot the working-class with “bad bets” and elitism. It’s not so much that Biden is a decent candidate. Americans are just tired of Trump’s American idiocy.</p>



<p>Biden looks like a phoenix. Although cross-eyed and tongue-tied. At least he knows when to shut up?</p>



<p>And that’s the only reason why he’s leading—heading into next week.</p>

<p>Perhaps where the most turmoil this year has taken place is during the campaign trail among the swing states. However, in the last few weeks all that has shifted.</p>



<p><strong>Trump had been leading</strong> in some of the places that won him the election in 2016. After cops gunned down more African Americans, protest movements across the country have drastically changed that dynamic.</p>



<p>Additionally, Trump’s promises have fallen flat in the Rust Belt. No jobs have been brought back. His rhetoric has become like mud underneath the wheels of a Ford pick-up truck. Dumb and useless.</p>



<p><strong>The only hope Trump has of winning</strong> next week is within the swing states where the outdated Electoral College can save a bratty, deranged white dude who also happens to be running the most powerful country on the planet in his seventies.</p>



<p>Unfortunately for the rest of the country, the same formula applies to Biden and his bottle and bib.</p>



<p>This is going to be hard to watch. But let’s check out some of the gambling odds…</p>



<h3 class="heading-slashbg-container">Texas, Florida, and Pennsylvania</h3>



<p>The top swing states between Trump and Biden are <strong>Texas, Florida, and Pennsylvania.</strong> Winning these states is going to be crucial for an all-out victory next week.</p>



<p>Currently, <strong>the Republicans are strongly favored (-450) in Texas</strong> against the <strong>Democrats (+275</strong>). <em>Newsweek</em> recently reported that Republicans have won Texas in the general election for nearly 50 years.</p>



<p>Trump and Biden were nearly deadlocked in Texas in July. And that has somewhat repeated this month. So, I think <strong>the odds aren’t exactly matching the polls</strong> here.</p>



<p>This is a must-win for the Trump campaign. Likewise in Florida.</p>



<p><strong>The Republicans are also favored, in the Sunshine State,</strong> at -160 to the <strong>Democrats at +120</strong>. This is supposed to be the state that determines the election. So, these odds are totally backward in comparison to the general election.</p>



<p>If Trump loses Florida, <strong>he’ll need to win </strong>Pennsylvania.</p>



<p>There, <strong>Republicans are underdogs</strong> <strong>at +135</strong> to the <strong>Democrats at -175</strong>. Polls this week have indicated that the two candidates are <strong>nearly tied</strong> in both Florida and Pennsylvania.</p>



<p><strong>I like the dog price </strong>in PA for Trump. Can the Democrats pull off an upset in Texas?</p>



<p>Although that might seem unlikely at first glance, it could be worth the price.</p>

</div>



<h3 class="heading-slashbg-container">Ohio, Iowa, North Carolina, and Georgia</h3>



<p>The other crucial swing states in this election are <strong>Ohio, Iowa, North Carolina, and Georgia. </strong>Whereas Trump once secured a victory among middle-America, he’s going to need to expand his reach across the country to win re-election in 2020.</p>



<p><em>The Wall Street Journal</em> did a piece earlier this month, claiming that Trump would need to win Ohio if he were to lose Florida in the general election. <strong>Republicans are favored in Ohio (-250)</strong> versus <strong>Democrats (+170)</strong>.</p>



<p>Trump and Biden have switched places about five times in the polls in Ohio, since August. Biden <em>did</em> try to curry favor thereby inviting former Ohio Republican governor, John Kasich, to the Democratic National Convention. But recently, Trump has pulled ahead by a few points.</p>



<p>Then there’s <strong>Iowa</strong>, where <strong>Republicans are favored</strong> <strong>at -190 </strong>against <strong>Democrats at +145</strong>. This is incredibly close even after Trump has led here for most of the year. Biden has climbed, somewhat.</p>



<p>I don’t really see that either candidate has anything to offer people in Ohio or Iowa. Other than their names on the ballot.</p>



<p>North Carolina has been an important state in my analysis especially when paired with another southern state such as Georgia. <strong>Republicans (-135) are favored</strong> in North Carolina against <strong>Democrats (-105)</strong>. They’re also <strong>favored</strong> in Georgi<strong>a, -190 to +140</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>I like the plus money</strong> with Democrats in Georgia and Iowa. If Trump can’t win North Carolina and Ohio, he’s going to be in trouble.</p>

<h3 class="heading-slashbg-container">Quick Rundown of Other Swing States</h3>



<p>Believe it or not, there are still more swing states to consider in this election. What used to be normal has changed. Purple states are now aquamarine.</p>



<p>Although a red state, seemingly, like <strong>Arizona is favored for the Republicans (-140)</strong> against <strong>Democrats (+100) </strong>by the slimmest of margins. How could Trump lose to Biden in Arizona?</p>



<p>Arizona has a lot of party schools. There’s no partying this year, on or off-campus in Arizona. Instead, it’s just another place where Trump has gained by just a few percentage points this month.</p>



<p><strong>Nevada</strong> is another close one, with <strong>Trump trailing at +170</strong> versus <strong>-250 for Democrats</strong>.</p>



<p>According to <em>The New York Times,</em> Arizona hasn’t voted Democrat in the general election since 1996. Also, Biden has led Trump in Nevada for most of 2020.</p>



<p>So it’s possible <strong>these two swing states could be split</strong> between Trump and Biden. An Arizona win is plausible for Republicans, while Democrats could repeat their close performance in Nevada.</p>

<h3 class="heading style2">My Picks for the Swing States</h3>



<p>Since the election is so close, the swing states are more important than ever. The areas of the country that won Trump the 2016 election have changed a lot over the summer.</p>



<p>My first pick is <strong>North Carolina</strong> <strong>(-135</strong>) for the Republicans. Trump started campaigning there when COVID-19 restrictions were eased. And I see that as a pillar in his re-election campaign and it’s one state where I think the polls will be wrong, in Trump’s favor.</p>



<p>The other swing states with bigger electoral votes are way more crucial. I think Trump will pick up <strong>Florida +135 and Texas</strong> <strong>+275</strong>. But Biden will win <strong>Pennsylvania</strong>. This is probably going to drive media pundits bonkers, just like in 2016.</p>



<p>If that happens, then states like <strong>Ohio, Iowa, and Georgia</strong> become very important. Ditto for <strong>Arizona</strong> and <strong>Nevada</strong>. As I said, I like Democrats to win in <strong>Iowa (+170)</strong> and <strong>Georgia</strong> <strong>(+140) </strong>as slight upset victories.</p>



<p>Then I like Trump to win in Ohio and Arizona, while the Democrats take Nevada but just barely.</p>

<p>A few months ago, <strong>I figured Trump would win re-election</strong> in 2020. That was before America got through its first wave during the COVID-19 pandemic. Since then, Trump has been decidedly unhinged.</p>



<p>The debates helped nothing, unfortunately. And while Trump hit the campaign trail, making himself into a martyr (in his own mind) after defeating the coronavirus only in his own body … Biden mostly kept to his basement bunker.</p>



<p>The more these candidates talked, the worse they seemed. <strong>If there wasn’t a global pandemic, I’d say Trump would cruise to victory</strong>—especially going against another corrupt career politician in steep cognitive decline.</p>



<h3 class="heading-slashbg-container">Trump&#8217;s Biggest Obstacle</h3>



<p>Since America has been the worst country in its fight against the coronavirus, it’s been the biggest obstacle between Trump garnering approval for a second term.</p>



<p>The only political acumen the Democrats have had during these last four years has been to nominate a candidate who is not only just as buffoonish and hollow as Trump—but also in coming up with a ticket that prevents any realistic change even if they were to defeat the incumbent.</p>



<p><strong>I think Biden is going to win the election</strong>, but only because the virus is stimulating political action all across the country. </p>



<h3 class="heading-slashbg-container">Americans are Awake</h3>



<p>People are awake to politics in America where unemployment is high and the country went months without sports and any positive solutions in sight.</p>



<p>A Biden victory is nothing more than the corrupt duopoly swinging from red to blue. To be honest, I don’t think either party cares all that much about anything other than staying in power.</p>



<p>That’s all these candidates seem to care about. Just ask their sons.</p>



<p>Consider yourself lucky if you’ve got enough money to burn on these clowns.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The final presidential debate will take place on Thursday night, Oct. 22, in Nashville, Tennessee, at 9 PM EST. Major networks will be broadcasting the debate live in a 90-minute, uninterrupted format.</p>



<p>On Monday, the Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD) announced that <strong>President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden will have two minutes of response time</strong>, just like the first debate. This time, however, when one candidate is speaking the other will have a muted mic.</p>



<p>Trump called this last-minute decision “unfair”. And his campaign manager referred to the CPD as a liberal conspiracy that favors Biden.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, Trump is still trailing Biden in nationwide polling. Although in some of the more important swing states, the two candidates have drawn closer over the last week.</p>



<h2 class="heading icon icon-fingerpoint">What Will the Candidates Cover in the Final Debate?</h2>



<p>According to the CPD, the <strong>six topics for the final debate</strong> will be COVID-19, American families, race in America, climate change, national security, and leadership.</p>



<p>In October, <strong>Trump’s approval rating</strong> is hovering around 44%. Among the largest samples for general election polling, <strong>Biden leads the incumbent</strong> by double digits.</p>



<p>So, this debate is going to be crucial for both campaigns.</p>



<h3 class="heading style2">Which Candidate is Favored Before the Debate?</h3>



<p>Trump is practically <strong>guaranteed to win Tennessee (-6000)</strong> where the debate will be held. This will be like a home-field advantage for the Super Bowl. Except the fan noise will be shut off when the other team gets the ball.</p>



<p>One of Trump’s only advantages against Biden at the first debate was being able to talk over Biden, throwing Sleepy Joe off his game.</p>



<p>If the coaching is right, Biden should get plenty of prep for his talking points on Thursday. All he’ll have to do is land a few good punches, while the president is muted, and that should be enough to show the American people how divisive Trump is as president.</p>



<p>The topics for the debate are some of the most divisive issues facing America today. I’m not sure Trump has any answers. And that’ll be poor optics for him in the final debate.</p>



<p>Biden might be the <strong>slight favorite</strong>.</p>



<p>Or as Trump might say: Bad!</p>

</div>



<h2 class="heading icon icon-payme">Odds Going Into Thursday’s Debate</h2>



<p>Going into Thursday’s debate, <strong>Biden (-160) is still favored to win the general election against Trump (+120).</strong> Those odds are clearly tilted somewhat for Biden only because Trump has completely botched America’s COVID-19 response.</p>



<p>The president even contracted the virus and he’s still acting like it’s no big deal. This is one major contrast to Biden’s campaign. It showcases just how divided America is right now, when a major pandemic has become endlessly politicized and bipartisan.</p>



<p>Trump would have to really fall flat on Thursday’s debate to get any worse odds than what he’s getting now.</p>



<p>Nationwide polling is where Biden has been the strongest. But that’s only pertinent to the popular vote in America. <strong>Democrats (-600) </strong>remain <strong>heavily favored</strong> to win the popular vote against <strong>Republicans (+350)</strong>.</p>

      <td> Democrats </td>
      <td><a href="https://www.safestbettingsites.com/visit/mybookie-politicsblogs/" data-action="presidential debete 2 odds table">-600</a></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td> Republicans </td>
      <td><a href="https://www.safestbettingsites.com/visit/mybookie-politicsblogs/" data-action="presidential debete 2 odds table">+350</a></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>



<p>I think that’s going to be the only certainty in the outcome of this election. The rest of everything else is a complete disaster—except for gambling. That’s the fun part.</p>



<h3 class="heading style2">Importance of Swing States in This Election</h3>



<p>The swing states will be the deciding factor in this election. Trump and Biden have both gained and lost some ground as early voting has begun.</p>



<p>In polling this week, <strong>Biden and Trump are practically tied</strong> in swing states like North Carolina, Georgia, Florida, and Pennsylvania. So it’s looking like Trump’s swing state victories that ultimately led him to win the 2016 election aren’t as certain this year.</p>



<p>It’s going to be close. I’ve gone back and forth myself about this. Both candidates aren’t that great.</p>



<p>Trump is really going to need to pull out a wild victory in some important places. It’s almost unfathomable that things have gotten this close two weeks before Election Day.</p>



<p>In any sane country, the deaths of 230,000 citizens from a public health crisis overseen by a ruling party, the opposition should cruise to a victory.</p>



<p>But that’s America for you.</p>

<h2 class="heading icon icon-usflag">Trump and Biden in Pennsylvania</h2>



<p>Also on Monday, it was announced that <strong>the Supreme Court voted 4-4</strong> to allow the state of Pennsylvania to count mail-in ballots up to three days after Election Day on November 3.</p>



<p>This was another decision that the Republicans decried. It’s no wonder. Pennsylvania has become one of the most critical states to win in this election.</p>



<p><strong>Trump (+185) </strong>is the <strong>underdog</strong> in Pennsylvania against Biden (-280). Again, I think these odds are a little too far in Biden’s favor.</p>



<p>Polling numbers may not be indicative of what will happen in two weeks. Especially with the Supreme Court’s decision that will allow ballots to be counted <em>three days after the election.</em></p>



<p>While that’s probably going to be BAD for the country, for <strong>betting purposes</strong> this might mean big money.</p>



<h3 class="heading style2">When Will the Loser Concede the Election?</h3>



<p>One of the more favorable wagers right now on MyBookie, when it comes to politics, is guessing when the loser will concede the election.</p>



<p>With this new Supreme Court ruling, <strong>the odds don’t match with the current reality.</strong> Since the swing states will most definitely decide the election, Pennsylvania is the cornerstone for this gamble.</p>



<p><strong>November 6th is getting +650</strong> for when the loser will concede the election. If it’s going to take the state three extra days to count their ballots, this isn’t such a bad bet.</p>



<p>Still, <strong>November 7th is getting +800 odds</strong> for being the day when the loser concedes the election.</p>



<p>If you play this one right, you might not need to work for the next six months. And that should be plenty of time to give you a buffer to leave the country (if you haven’t already) as it descends into constitutional chaos.</p>



<p>Of course, there’s no wager for neither Trump nor Biden to concede defeat. Which is strange, considering that’s what seems to be the most likely outcome going into Thursday’s final presidential debate.</p>



<p>It should be a fun one, depending on how you look at things.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>On Friday, October 16th, BetOnline.ag and SportsBetting.ag were taken offline due to a DDoS cyber-attack</strong>. The industry-leading betting sites were down for much of the weekend, including most of NFL Sunday and the entire day for Saturday’s college football schedule.</p>



<p><strong>As of Monday, the website for both sportsbooks, which share the same support and cashier, has stabilized. </strong>But, both sites have stated they are not entirely out of the woods yet.</p>



<p>However, their downtime has brought a lot of questions from bettors, including if their funds safe with BetOnline.ag and SportsBetting.ag and what exactly is the risk with these DDoS attacks.</p>



<h2 class="heading icon icon-payme">Are My Funds Safe At BetOnline.ag And SportsBetting.ag?</h2>



<p>Yes, this attack does not pose a risk to players’ funds. While the website did have some downtime, by all accounts, <strong>bettors’ personal information was not corrupted or stolen during the attack.</strong></p>



<p>Aside from the attack, it’s worth noting that BetOnline.ag and <a href="https://www.safestbettingsites.com/reviews/sportsbetting-ag-review">SportsBetting.ag</a> are elite sportsbooks. They have large betting limits, have been in the industry for over 20 years, and have some of the fastest payouts online.</p>



<p>At SBS, we’ve had them as one of our most highly rated sportsbooks for years and there are little to no complaints from players. Rest assured, your funds are safe and secure at both betting sites.</p>



<h2 class="heading icon icon-headquestions">What Is A DDoS Attack?</h2>



<p>DDoS stands for “distributed denial of service.” Basically, a group of hackers flood a website with excess traffic or information and make it unusable for normal traffic. </p>



<p>The hackers then demand a ransom, usually in the payment of a cryptocurrency, and state they will stop the attacks if the ransom is paid.&nbsp;</p>



<p>DDoS attacks are extremely common. These attacks almost always pose no risk of personal data being stolen by hackers but cause many websites, including online sportsbooks to lose business or be unable to operate.</p>



<p>In fact, these attacks are extremely common, especially in the offshore betting industry. <a href="https://www.safestbettingsites.com/best-online-sportsbooks">Sports betting sites</a> often receive these attacks while the hackers are demanding payment in their live chat support.</p>



<p>Truly, they’re nothing BetOnline and SportsBetting haven’t dealt with before. This is just a blimp on the radar for two of the most trusted sportsbooks in the online gaming industry.</p>

<p>UFC 254 is finally here, and the hype is real.</p>



<p><strong>The matchup between Justin Gaethje and Khabib Nurmagomedov promises to be the fight of the year</strong>. There is no other way of putting it.</p>



<p>The UFC Lightweight Championship belt will be there for whoever wants it more when Gaethje and Khabib met in the UFC 254 main event. The meeting will be at Fight Island in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates.</p>

<p>Let’s break it down.</p>



<h2 class="heading icon icon-trophy">What the odds say about Khabib vs. Gaethje UFC 254 Fight</h2>



<table class="style2" style="max-width: 500px; margin: 0 auto 10px;">

</tr>
<tr>
    <td>Justin Gaethje</td>
    <td><a href="https://www.safestbettingsites.com/visit/mybookie-mmapicks/" data-action="ufc odds table justin">+270</a></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>



<p>MyBookie has Khabib as the favorite on <strong>the moneyline -354, while Gaethje upset pays +270</strong>. The Russian is undefeated, so it’s no surprise.</p>



<p>If you are new at <a href="https://www.safestbettingsites.com/mixed-martial-arts-betting/">mixed martial arts betting</a>, you need to lay down $354 to win $100 if you think Khabib will be the winner. A Gaethje’s win will get you $270 for every $100 you bet.</p>



<p>The <strong>total is at 4.5 rounds</strong>, with the under having a big juice of -170 at the moment. You can find <strong>the over at +140</strong>.</p>



<h2 class="heading icon icon-fivestars">What we know about Justin Gaethje</h2>



<p>Justin Gaethje earned his spot in this showdown. Make no mistake about it.</p>



<p>His performance against Tony Ferguson was the best of his career, despite taking that fight on short notice. Gaethje overwhelmed Ferguson with aggressiveness, leg kicks, and a nasty left hook.</p>



<p><strong>Ferguson had a 12-fight win streak when he met Justin and looked like the baddest MF’s on the planet</strong>. But, Gaethje was not fazed. Instead of waiting, he went on the attack, delivering haymakers for 30 minutes.</p>



<div class="wp-block-sbs-youtube lazy-youtube" data-id="eT7In0pjz_4" data-width="560" data-height="315"></div>



<p>I repeat this wasn’t a fluke. Gaethje earned his spot fair and square, even winning nine UFC bonuses in his last seven fights. He has won four contests in a row since losing to Dustin Poirier back in 2018.</p>



<p>All his last nine wins have been via KO/TKO. Only Tony Ferguson, who is a freak of nature when it comes to swallowing punches, held on until the fifth round before the refs stopped the fight.</p>



<p>The interesting thing about fighting Khabib is, the Russian is not a striker per se. If they meet on the ground, Gaethje knows his way around the mat. Justin was a wrestler all his life, although his UFC style has translated into more striking.</p>



<p>“Nothing will happen on the cage. We will fight in the center of the octagon. As much as he’s going to want to fight on the edge of the octagon, we’re going to fight in the center”, Gaethje said on the UFC Unfiltered podcast.</p>

</div>



<h2 class="heading icon icon-fivestars">What we know about Khabib Nurmagomedov</h2>



<p>UFC fans know this, but it still is good to remember. Khabib Nurmagomedov is the best UFC lightweight fighter in the world, and no one comes close. At least for now.</p>



<p>For many, Khabib is the best pound-for-pound fighter in the world. Yet, that discussion is up in the air when you remember Jon Jones still alive.</p>



<p>Either way, Nurmagomedov enters this fight undefeated in 28 contests. 18 of his performances finished either with a TKO/KO or a submission stoppage.</p>



<h2 class="heading-slashbg-container">COVID-19 Took Khabib Vs. Tony Away From Us</h2>



<p>Khabib should have fought Tony Ferguson back in May, but because of the Coronavirus restrictions worldwide, he couldn’t fly out of Russia.</p>



<p>COVID-19 also took away his father, Abdulmanap Nurmagomedov, in July. He was placed in a medically induced coma after contracting COVID-19 following heart surgery and died days later.</p>



<p>Khabib’s father was his trainer and was on his corner for most of his fights. He hasn’t fought since September 2019, when he beat Dustin Poirier at UFC 242 in the third round.</p>



<p>Nurmagomedov has been training with Javier Mendez, a long-time friend from his dad. Khabib and Javier are not unfamiliar to each other as Mendez led the corner when the Russian beat Conor McGregor back in October 2018.</p>

<h3><a class="button-redbg" href="https://www.safestbettingsites.com/visit/mybookie-mmapicks/" data-action="highlight box ufc">Bet On Khabib Nurmagomedov At MyBookie</a></h3>
</div>



<h2 class="heading icon icon-yellow-star">UFC 254 Khabib vs. Gaethje Betting Predictions</h2>



<p>Justin Gaethje represents a danger for Khabib Nurmagomedov for two reasons. Number one, Gaethje is a freak who loves to attack and fight on his terms.</p>



<p>He even mentioned he wants to put doubt on Khabib’s mind. When they asked him how he planned to do that, he responded: “with violence.”</p>



<p>Number two, his wrestling background is uncanny. He’s not a fighter who learned how to wrestle in the process. He’s a wrestler who tweaked his style over the years and found unexpected success, punching and kicking people all over the place.</p>



<h3 class="heading-slashbg-container">Gaethje’s Biggest Problem</h3>



<p>But he’s a pure wrestler, and that’s what makes this matchup so interesting.</p>



<p>Now, Gaethje’s biggest problem is the guy in front of him is an unsolved puzzle. Nobody has come close to beating Khabib Nurmagomedov. When the takedowns come, his sambo style, savviness, and strength put opponents in a stage of shock.</p>



<p>You can prepare all you want for this, but the Russian is an incredible fighter that cannot be replicated.</p>



<p>Khabib can land punches too. His corner prefers he doesn’t get involved in a brawl, but the ability is there. Against McGregor, his coach Javier Mendez insisted he shouldn’t trade punches with the Irishman. In the end, Khabib listened and won easily.</p>



<p>This is the fight of the year. It should be fantastic.</p>



<p>I have Khabib winning via decision. Until someone beats this polar bear, that is the only bet you need to make. <strong>Bet Khabib Nurmagomedov -354 &amp; Over 4.5 rounds (+140)</strong>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>We gave you some solid four out of six winners last week.</p>



<p>The idea is to give you a perfect 6-0 record, but Joe insists on going against me head-to-head, and that hasn’t worked well for him this season.</p>



<p>Keep in mind, this week there is a doubleheader on Monday and no Thursday Night game.</p>



<p>Let’s do this.</p>



<h2 class="heading icon icon-football">Joe’s NFL Week 6 Picks Against The Spread</h2>



<h3 class="heading style2">Detroit Lions -3 At Jacksonville</h3>



<p>The talk about the Jaguars before the season started was that they were the worst team in the NFL and they could be historically terrible. That tune changed quite a bit after they beat the Colts in Week 1.</p>



<p>However, it’s been all downhill for Jacksonville since that Week 1 victory. They have lost four straight games and not exactly against the toughest bunch of teams.</p>



<p>Their 30-14 beatdown by the Texans was Houston’s first win of the season and their previous two losses came against the Dolphins and the Bengals.</p>



<p>Make no mistake, Detroit is a bad football team and they have one of the worst head coaches in the league. However, I still think they’re miles ahead of Jacksonville.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Lions have faced the Bears, Packers, Cardinals, and Saints so far. That’s a much tougher schedule than most teams have gone through this year. They’re also coming off a bye in Week 5.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I like the rested Detroit Lions on the road here. <strong>Lay the points</strong>.</p>



<div class="highlight-box success" style="text-align: center;">
<h3><a class="button-redbg" href="https://www.safestbettingsites.com/visit/mybookie-nflpicks/" data-action="nfl wk 6 ats">Bet Lions -3 At MyBookie.Ag</a></h3>
</div>



<h3 class="heading style2">Kansas City Chiefs -3.5 At Buffalo</h3>



<p>Two of the AFC’s best will face off on Monday as the Chiefs visit the Bills. Both teams suffered their first loss of the season in Week 5.</p>



<p>The Chiefs lost to the visiting Raiders and Buffalo lost to a Titans team on Tuesday night that was not able to practice for two weeks. Go figure.</p>



<p>I don’t love laying -3.5, especially not on the road, but I think this an excellent bounce-back spot for Kansas City. As I mentioned in last week’s article, their defense looks weak, but that doesn’t stop them from scoring in bunches.</p>



<p>We saw some of the “old Josh Allen” last week. A guy that can make big plays, but when things go wrong, there are a lot of turnovers. Not to mention, the Bills defense didn’t look especially strong against the Titans offense.</p>



<p>Tennessee is no slouch offensively, but they’re not Kansas City. I have no doubt we’ll see fireworks in this one from KC’s offense and <strong>I simply don’t think the Bills can keep up</strong>.</p>



<div class="highlight-box success" style="text-align: center;">
<h3><a class="button-redbg" href="https://www.safestbettingsites.com/visit/mybookie-nflpicks/" data-action="nfl wk 6 ats">Bet Chiefs -3.5 At MyBookie.Ag</a></h3>
</div>



<h3 class="heading style2">Dallas Cowboys +2 Vs. Cardinals</h3>



<p>I’m not sure I’ve seen a number this off, at least in my mind, in quite a few years in the NFL. I honestly believe the <a href="https://www.safestbettingsites.com/nfl-betting/teams/cowboys" data-type="page" data-id="5721">Dallas Cowboys</a> should be favored (and perhaps substantially) in this spot.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They’re a 2-3 team after last week’s win against the visiting Giants, while the Cardinals sit at 3-2 after blowing out the Jets in New York.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I think Arizona is one of the more overrated teams in the NFL. Their schedule has been mostly easy and they just lost their best interior defender last week, Chandler Jones, for the season.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These odds are a clear overreaction to Dak Prescott’s injury.</p>



<p>Dak is a good quarterback, but Dalton may be the best backup in the league. Also, he’s a strong fit for this offense that is centered on talented wide receivers and a strong offensive line.</p>



<p>Arizona has no business being a favorite in this game. I think <strong>you can play the Dallas +2 with confidence</strong> and take some plus money on them to win outright via the moneyline.</p>



<div class="highlight-box success" style="text-align: center;">
<h3><a class="button-redbg" href="https://www.safestbettingsites.com/visit/mybookie-nflpicks/" data-action="nfl wk 6 ats">Bet Cowboys +2 At MyBookie.Ag</a></h3>
</div>



<h2 class="heading icon icon-football">Alonzo’s NFL Week 6 Picks Against The Spread</h2>



<h3 class="heading style2">Green Bay Packers -1.5 At Tampa Bay</h3>



<p>Aaron Rodgers vs. Tom Brady should be the marquee game on any week in the NFL, but Tampa Bay hasn’t played well this season. It makes the decision to back up the Packers easy.</p>



<p>The Buccaneers have struggled to protect Brady while their offensive weapons are dealing with injuries. WR Chris Godwin has missed the last two games, and Mike Evans is hobbling an ankle injury.</p>



<p>Also, <strong>Tampa Bay is one of the most undisciplined teams in the NFL</strong>. They have the second most penalty yards in the league.</p>



<p>Rodgers is playing at a high level and should wrap this game up early in the fourth quarter. I haven’t even mentioned the <a href="https://www.safestbettingsites.com/nfl-betting/teams/packers" data-type="page" data-id="5765">Green Bay Packers</a> are coming off a bye, and WR Davante Adams will be back in the lineup. Swallow the points.</p>

</div>



<h3 class="heading style2">Washington Football Team +2.5 At NY Giants</h3>



<p>The Giants will win eventually, right? But it won’t be this weekend.</p>



<p>New York’s offense is one of the worst in the NFL, sitting at dead last running the football and second-worst scoring points.</p>



<p>Washington is not a great team either, but at least their defensive line stills battle to make their opponents uncomfortable.</p>



<p>Kyle Allen should start at QB for the Football Team. He scored a touchdown and moved the ball well against the Rams last week before leaving because of an injury.</p>



<p>This will be an ugly game, but <strong>you are better off taking the points</strong>.</p>



<div class="highlight-box success" style="text-align: center;">
<h3><a class="button-redbg" href="https://www.safestbettingsites.com/visit/mybookie-nflpicks/" data-action="nfl wk 6 ats">Bet Washington +2.5 At MyBookie.Ag</a></h3>
</div>



<h3 class="heading style2">Arizona Cardinals -2 At Dallas</h3>



<p>As you can see above, Joe backed up Dallas. He’s 0-2 against me in head-to-head games and soon to be 0-3.</p>



<p>All that Dalton talk is cute, but Joe failed to mention the Cowboys defense is atrocious. They are dead last in the NFL in points allowed with 36.0 PPG.</p>



<p>Last week they allowed 34 points to the Giants, a team that entered the game with only three touchdowns scored in the first four weeks of the season.</p>



<p>The Cowboys defense is indescribably bad, and they have to deal with Kyler Murray, DeAndre Hopkins, and the rest of the Cardinals&#8217; offense. Hopkins, by the way, leads the NFL in receiving yards.</p>



<p>There is no home-field advantage that can save this Dallas defense. <strong>Bet the Cards</strong>.</p>
